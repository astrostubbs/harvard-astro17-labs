Gaia is a fantastic mission that is measuring very precise parallax and proper motions of stars.  Here we have gathered data on 10,000 stars that have a parallax more than 5 milli-arcsecond, i.e., a distance less than 200 pc.  Gaia produces photometry in 3 bands, called BP, G, and RP in order of wavelength.  These are apparent magnitudes."
