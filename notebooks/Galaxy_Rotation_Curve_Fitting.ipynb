The rotation curve represents the velocity of stars and gas in a galaxy as a function of their distance from the center. Understanding these curves helps in studying the distribution of mass within galaxies.\n","\n","## Introduction to Galaxy Rotation Curves\n","\n","The study of galaxy rotation curves has been pivotal in the field of astrophysics, particularly in the context of dark matter research. The rotation curve of a galaxy is a plot of the orbital velocities of stars or gas in the galaxy against their radial distance from the galaxy's center.\n","\n","### Historical Context\n","\n","The pioneering work of **Vera Rubin** and **Kent Ford** in the 1970s provided the first clear evidence for the presence of dark matter. They observed that the rotation curves of spiral galaxies were flat, contrary to the expected decrease in velocity with increasing distance from the galactic center if only visible matter was present. This discovery challenged existing theories of galactic dynamics and suggested that a significant amount of unseen mass, or dark matter, exists. The concept of dark matter has become a fundamental aspect of modern cosmology, influencing our understanding of the universe's structure and evolution.\n","\n","### Models to Fit\n","\n","In this notebook, we explore three models to fit the rotation curve:\n","\n","1. **Point Mass at the Center**: Assumes a single massive object at the center.\n","2. **Spherical Halo**: Considers a dark matter halo with a density profile $\\rho(R) \\sim \\frac{1}{(a+R)^2}$.\n","3. **Uniform Disk**: Models the galaxy as a disk with uniform surface density $\\Sigma$.\n","\n","These models help us understand different components of galaxies and the possible distribution of dark matter. Each model offers unique insights into the mass distribution and dynamics of galaxies.\n","\n","### References\n","\n","- Rubin, V. C., & Ford, W. K. Jr. (1970).
